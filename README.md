Manage your Nimiq wallets directly in your browser

This extension lets you manage all your Nimiq wallets directly in your browser. The extension connects directly to the Nimiq blockchain and gives you instant access to your funds. You can easily import your existing wallets, switch between them and send Nimiq directly from the extension.

The extension also supports mining, so you can mine Nimiq whenever your browser is running, without having to visit the betanet webpage.

A contact list, creating cashlinks and the wallet history are coming soon!
